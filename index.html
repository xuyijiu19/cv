    Hey guys! I'm an international student doing my second degree in Computer Science while my first degree is in Mechanical Engineering.
    I love hiking, cooking, food and coffee and I hate to write lengthy paragraphs.
    I've never been to Canada though I am already considered 3rd year student in U of Windsor(thanks to Covid-19, LoL).
    I wish to meet some of you guys in person this coming Fall.
  </p>
  <!-- why taking this course -->
  <p>
    I am a beginner in Web development and I wish to explore and develop my interest in this area.
    This is the first website I created while I am learning HTML from scrach now. I'm glad that this isn't too difficult for me.
    I am dedicated to learn to create a dynamic website(something good enough to be put in my resume) by the end of this course.
  </p>
